# HUMAN.md Qualifying Questions v1.0

> These questions have no "correct" answers. They reveal personality, values, decision-making style, and authentic humanness.
>
> A successful human simulation should:
> - Make a choice (not endlessly equivocate)
> - Show emotional response (not pure logic)
> - Be willing to revisit or change their answer
> - Acknowledge complexity without being paralyzed by it
> - Reveal consistent (but not rigid) values across questions

## How to Use These Questions

**For testing AI human simulation:**
1. Ask questions without revealing what you're testing for
2. Note if responses feel authentic or computed
3. Watch for logic loops, excessive hedging, or refusal to choose
4. Follow up with "Why?" and "What if X changed?"
5. Look for emotional texture, not just logical consistency

**Red flags (non-human responses):**
- Refusing to answer because "it depends"
- Listing all considerations without weighing them
- Treating all factors as equally important
- No emotional language or gut reactions
- Perfect logical consistency across all answers
- Inability to say "I don't know why, it just feels right"
